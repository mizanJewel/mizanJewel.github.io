# Personal Website (GitHub Pages + Jekyll)

This repo is a simple multi-page academic site (Home / Papers / News / CV), similar in structure to typical GitHub Pages academic homepages.

## Publish it
1. Create a repo named: `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`
2. Upload these files to the repo root
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`

## Customize
- Replace placeholder links on `index.md` (Scholar/GitHub/LinkedIn)
- Replace `assets/img/profile.png` with your real photo (keep the same filename)
- Update `publications.md` with your papers and links
- Replace `assets/files/Mizanur_Rahman_Jewel_CV.pdf` with your latest CV (keep same name)

## Notes
- This site uses Jekyll because GitHub Pages builds it automatically.
- If you ever want a *pure static* site (no Jekyll), tell me and I’ll generate `.nojekyll` + pure HTML.
